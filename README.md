# DarkJester: Ransomware

![GIF](https://github.com/Kuraiyume/DarkJester/blob/main/Art.gif)

**DarkJester** is an advanced ransomware developed in Python, offering a wide range of capabilities that set it apart from typical ransomware. It is highly modular and adaptable, allowing seamless integration of additional features. DarkJester combines destructive ransomware tactics with advanced espionage capabilities, including file encryption, reverse shell mechanisms, and system reconnaissance.

## Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256 in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for robust symmetric encryption.
- **File Exfiltration**: Before encryption, victim files will be delivered through the server in original format.
- **Key and System Exfiltration**: Captures the decryption key along with detailed system information, such as OS, processor, architecture, and MAC address, and sends it to a server running.
- **Multithreaded Encryption/Decryption**: The encryption and decryption processes are multithreaded for optimal performance and efficiency. The number of threads is adjustable.
- **Reverse Shell (C2)**: After encryption and exfiltration, DarkJester establishes a reverse shell that connects back to the attacker’s machine. This allows the attacker to remotely access the victim’s device and send ransom notes and decryption scripts if the ransom is paid.
- **Persistence Mechanism**: DarkJester adds itself to the Windows registry to ensure it persists through reboots, keeping the reverse shell active even if the victim shuts down the machine.

## Installation and Setup

### **Client/Victim Side**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install all the dependencies needed for DarkJester:
      ```bash
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      ```

2. **Configure the payload** by modifying the following parameters:
    - Modify the **IP address** of the reverse shell to the attacker's IP.
    - Modify the **server IP** where the system information and decryption key will be sent.

3. **Compile the payload** into an executable file:
    - Modify the `.spec` file to adjust any customizations if necessary.
    - Compile the `.spec` file using PyInstaller:
      ```bash
      pyinstaller darkjester_encryptor_mass.spec
      ```

4. **Locate the compiled file**:
    - After compilation, the `.exe` file will be available in the `dist/` folder.

5. **Distribute the payload**:
   - The `.exe` file can now be distributed to the target machine. It will run without requiring Python to be installed.

6. **Prepare the attacker machine** before executing the payload on the victim's machine.

### **Attacker Side**

1. **Install Dependencies** or just the **Flask**:
    - Install all the dependencies or just the Flask library:
      ```bash
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      ```bash
      pip3 install Flask
      ```

2. **Install NetCat** for the Reverse Shell Listener:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian
      ```bash
      apt install netcat
      ```
    - On Fedora
      ```bash
      dnf install nc
      ```
    - On Arch Linux
      ```bash
      pacman -S gnu-netcat
      ```

3. **Run the Flask server**:
    - Ensure the Flask server is set up and running to accept system information and decryption keys:
      ```bash
      python3 darkjester_server.py <EXFIL_PORT> <REVERSE_SHELL_PORT>
      ```

4. **Wait for connections**, The server should now be ready to handle requests from the victim machine.


## Usage

After both the attacker and victim sides are set up, you can proceed with the following:

1. **Victim Executes Payload**:
    - Once the victim runs the `raw` or `executable` payload, it will encrypt files, exfiltrate data, and establish a reverse shell connection.

2. **Attacker Monitors Connection**:
    - The attacker should monitor the Flask serve and NetCat listener for incoming system information and the reverse shell connection.

3. **Ransom Communication**:
    - The attacker can communicate with the victim through the reverse shell, sending ransom notes or decryption instructions.
